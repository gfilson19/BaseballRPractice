# LearningR 
Thanks for checking out my Github profile! This is where I've been practicing using R to analyze baseball data. In a baseball world containing literally billions of data points, its clearly important to be able to create visualizations, interpret and analyze the data for practical use for your ballclub. While I did not study computer science at Florida State in favor of Finance, I have done my best to continuosly expose myself to programming languages such as R and SQL since my 2019 graduation. The book "Analyzing Baseball Data with R" has been a big help, Robert Frey YouTube videos taught me how to scrape multiple years worth of Statcast Data, and in 2020's quarantine I even signed up for some online R and statistics classes put out by Johns Hopkins and Duke professors. So far with several months of R practice and exposure in the books, I certainly feel I still have the drive and capability to keep learning more advanced concepts. I'll continue to try to expand my knowledge and skills with these things as I try to provide value to an organization in 2021 after being furloughed from my first baseball job in 2020. Please reach out to my e-mail if you have any tips as this is very much so a learning effort! GF17@my.fsu.edu
